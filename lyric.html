            Sweeter than honey, think you're going crazy
            Come with me and float downstream
            Nothing to worry, no one is waiting
            Love every moment of life, life, life

            Flowers so pretty, vision going blurry
            The world is slowing down
            We're not in a hurry, get yourself comfy
            Love every moment of life, life, life

            Oh, far as the eye can see
            There's nothing left to see
            My darling, my darling

            Feeling kinda funny, everything is trippy
            Come with me and float downstream
            Join us, we're waiting, whenever you're ready
            
            Love every moment of life, life, life
            Everybody's leaving, don't be scared joining
            Come with me and float downstream
            Unexpected flying, searching for a meaning
            Love every moment of life, life, life
            
            Oh, far as the eye can see
            There's nothing left to see
            My darling, my darling (ooh-la-la)
            My darling, my darling (ooh-la-la)
            My darling, my darling (ooh-la-la)
            
            Take cover, world is crumbling down
            Now or never, no one is left behind
            Uncover everything, don't miss out
            All the colours, all the colours
            
            Sweeter than honey, think you're going crazy
            Come with me and float downstream
            Nothing to worry, no one is waiting
            Love every moment of life, life, life</pre>
